# JavaScript Sorting Task

Write a JavaScript which sorts in ascending order an array of numbers which are introduced by the user in a `<textarea>` or `<input type="text">` tag. The sorted array (which can have any length) will be displayed in a `<table>` with 5 columns and n/5 lines where n is the length of the array.
