# HTML+CSS Web Document Project

Develop an HTML+CSS web document that looks like the following web page: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/). You should clone about one screen of this web page (not the whole web page) and your HTML document should look approximately 90% like the given web page. No interactivity should be added (e.g. JavaScript, :hover effects, etc.) and you are not allowed to use any CSS or JavaScript library.
