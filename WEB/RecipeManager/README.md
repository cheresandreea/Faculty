# ASP .NET Web Application Project

Develop a web application based on ASP .NET. All web pages should be accessible only if the user logs in using a username and a password (create a session each time a user logs in, and destroy the session when the user logs out).

## Have in mind the user experience when you implement the problem:

- Add different validation logic for input fields.
- Do not force the user to input an ID for an item if they want to delete/edit/insert it; this should happen automatically (e.g., the user clicks an item from a list, and a page/modal prepopulated with the data for that particular item is opened, where the user can edit it).
- Add confirmation when the user deletes/cancels an item.
- Do a bare minimum CSS that at least aligns the various input fields.

## Problems

Solve the same problem you got for the PHP lab, but using the ASP .NET technology. In addition to the specification for the PHP lab, your application must implement user authentication and ask the user to authenticate themselves prior to using the web application (based on a username and password saved in the database).
